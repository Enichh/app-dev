Hi, I'm Enoch Gabriel M. Astor, a BSIT A505 student.
I enjoy building projects, learning new tech, and sharing the things I love â€” from coding to musicals and great TV shows.
ðŸš€ My Projects
Here are some of the apps and tools I've worked on:
- [STI-DigiLibrary](https://github.com/Enichh/STI-DigiLibrary)
- [Enoch Movies](https://enochmovies.netlify.app/)
- [STI Grade Calculator](https://stigradecalculator.netlify.app/)
- [Grade Calculator STI](https://gradecalculatorsti.netlify.app/)
- [Money Tracker](https://moneytrackerenoch.netlify.app/)
Each project helped me practice problem-solving, design, and coding skills while making something useful.
ðŸŽ­ Why I Love Hamilton
