## 🎭 Hamilton

I absolutely love **Hamilton: An American Musical**!  
It’s a revolutionary piece of art that tells Alexander Hamilton’s story through a brilliant mix of hip-hop, R&B, pop, and traditional musical theater.

**Why I Love It:**
- Innovative storytelling  
- Masterpiece-level music (“My Shot,” “The Room Where It Happens”)  
- Incredibly talented cast  
- Themes of legacy, ambition, love, and loss  

*"I am not throwing away my shot!"* 🎶

## 📺 Breaking Bad

One of the greatest TV shows ever made — a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and tension.

**Why It’s My Favorite:**
- Walter White’s gripping transformation  
- Cinematography that feels like art  
- Brilliant writing and attention to detail  
- Career-defining performances by Bryan Cranston & Aaron Paul  
- Edge-of-your-seat tension  

*"I am the one who knocks."* 💀
