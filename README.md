🎭 Why I Love Hamilton
Hamilton is a musical that mixes hip-hop, R&B, and classic show tunes to tell the story of Alexander Hamilton.
What makes it special to me:
- A diverse cast that brings history to life
- Powerful lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda
- A fresh, creative way of telling a historical story
It's not just history — it feels alive, emotional, and unforgettable.
