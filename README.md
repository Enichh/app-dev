Hi, I'm Enoch Gabriel M. Astor, a BSIT A505 student.
I enjoy building projects, learning new tech, and sharing the things I love — from coding to musicals and great TV shows.

🚀 My Projects
Here are some of the apps and tools I've worked on:
- [STI-DigiLibrary](https://github.com/Enichh/STI-DigiLibrary)
- [Enoch Movies](https://enochmovies.netlify.app/)
- [STI Grade Calculator](https://stigradecalculator.netlify.app/)
- [Grade Calculator STI](https://gradecalculatorsti.netlify.app/)
- [Money Tracker](https://moneytrackerenoch.netlify.app/)

Each project helped me practice problem-solving, design, and coding skills while making something useful.

🎭 Why I Love Hamilton
Hamilton is a musical that mixes hip-hop, R&B, and classic show tunes to tell the story of Alexander Hamilton.

What makes it special to me:
- A diverse cast that brings history to life
- Powerful lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda
- A fresh, creative way of telling a historical story

It's not just history — it feels alive, emotional, and unforgettable.

💻 My First Repository
app-dev — where it all started. This was my first step into coding projects and version control.

📺 My Favorite Series: Breaking Bad
Breaking Bad is a show about Walter White, a chemistry teacher who slowly transforms into a drug kingpin. It's intense, smart, and unforgettable.

What Makes It Great
- Acting: Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are incredible
- Story: Every episode builds suspense and keeps you hooked
- Cinematography: Creative and stylish shots
- Characters: Deep, complex, and always evolving

Main Characters
- Walter White – Teacher turned meth producer
- Jesse Pinkman – Walter's ex-student and partner
- Skyler White – Walter's wife
- Hank Schrader – DEA agent and Walter's brother-in-law
