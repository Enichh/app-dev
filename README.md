## Why I love Hamilton the Musical

Hamilton is a revolutionary musical that brilliantly combines hip-hop, R&B, and traditional show tunes to tell the story of American founding father Alexander Hamilton. The diverse cast, powerful lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda, and innovative storytelling make it a masterpiece that brings history to life in an unforgettable way.
